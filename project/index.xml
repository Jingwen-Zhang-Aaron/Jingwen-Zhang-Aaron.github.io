      <title>Bipedal Robotic Locomotion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BRUCE (Bipedal Robot Unit with Compliance Enhanced) is a miniature bipedal robot with proprioceptive actuation. Each leg gof BRUCE has 5 degrees of freedom, which include a spherical hip joint, a knee joint, and an ankle joint. BRUCE is being developed in order to make it as an open-source and accessible miniature humanoid robotic platform for studies on humanoid dynamic behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NABi2 (Non-Anthropomorphic Biped V2) is a low cost, low complexity bipedal robot that can walk, jump, and even dance! NABi is built with lightweight, modular components, but its design modifies the traditional humanoid form by aligning its legs in a plane, allowing it to only have 4 actuated joints compared to the normal 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working on applying optimization-based methods to improve their performance on dynamic behaviours, like jumping and running. At the same time, sensor improvement is being conducted in order to track optimized trajectories better. More publications on this project are coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wall Climbing Robot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SiLVIA (Six Legged Vehicle with Intelligent Articulation) is a six-legged robot who can brace itself between two vertical walls and climb vertically with end-effectors that only use friction. Previsouly, we already implemented a two-stage optimization method to plan the on-wall motions so that it can deal with irregular wall profiles. And transition behaviours are also optimized using a nonlinear programming. Please check details on our papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I am working on modelling a potential coupling relationship between controllable contact forces and uncontrollable contact torques. All of previous planners will benefit from this model so as to improve the performance on the real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>INNOVA HAND, a Versatile and Simple Robotic Hand</title>
      <link>https://jingwen-zhang.github.io/project/3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To balance cost and dexterity, current robotic hands for service robot are mainly focused on 2 or 3 finger underactuated hands. Inspired by winter mitten, even with four fingers tied together human hand are still functional to grasp a wide range of objects. INNOVA used one Thumb and one four-in-one Finger to accomplish fingertip, enveloping and fist grasping pose.&lt;/p&gt;
